This file documents the idx struct used in the ETwireSim code.
Field               Description
.elect              struct that contains electrical indices
    .dir            indices for electric Dirichlet nodes (union of .excitation and .gnd)
    .dof            indices for electric degrees of freedom
.therm              struct that contains thermal indices
    .dir            indices for thermal Dirichlet nodes (union of .excitation and .gnd)
    .dof            indices for thermal degrees of freedom
